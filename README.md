# mtg-card-webapp

A web application for viewing information on Magic: The Gathering cards and building a personal library of cards that you like.

The application combines an ASP.NET Web Form with a mySQL database provisioned through AWS's Relational Database Service (RDS). The website itself runs on an Expanded Cloud Compute (EC2) instance running CentOS. Other services such as the Simple Storage Service (used for block storage) and the Identity Access and Management service (for authentication) are also employed, as are several Python scripts and shell scripts.
